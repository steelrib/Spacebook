 Final project for an intro to web development course... It did what it needed to do but there were things I wanted to do with it that I still want to accomplish.

 I wanted to use javascript to compile a summary of the form input on the "success.html" page, that I set as the value from the action attribute.

 I also couldn't figure out a way to use Javascript to validate that at least one checkbox had been selected.

 I will have to add some comments on my javascript that show my attempts.

 Any feedback or tips would be greatly appreciated!!!

 I'm going to submit another page with a similar concept - basic web page with some CSS styling, an image, and a form input that runs some script during onfocus and onblur events, and creating a summary compiling input values when clicking submit.
